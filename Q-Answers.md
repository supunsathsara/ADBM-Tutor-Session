### Question 1 (SQL Server)

#### 1.1 Opinion on "Windows Authentication is better than SQL Authentication"

**Opinion:** Agree

**Explanation:**
Windows Authentication is often considered better than SQL Authentication for several reasons:

1. **Security:** Windows Authentication uses Active Directory (AD) accounts which can leverage Windows security policies, such as password complexity, account lockout, and multi-factor authentication. This makes it inherently more secure.
2. **Centralized Management:** User accounts and permissions are managed centrally in Active Directory, simplifying user management and reducing administrative overhead.
3. **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Users can use their Windows credentials to access SQL Server without needing to remember a separate set of credentials, enhancing the user experience.
4. **Kerberos Protocol:** Windows Authentication can use the Kerberos security protocol, which is more secure than the NTLM protocol typically used by SQL Authentication.
5. **Reduced Attack Surface:** Since SQL Authentication requires storing and transmitting passwords, it increases the attack surface. Windows Authentication avoids this by using token-based authentication.

#### 1.2 Reason for Taking SQL Server Differential Backups

**Explanation:**
Differential backups are taken instead of full backups in certain situations because:

1. **Efficiency:** Differential backups only capture the data that has changed since the last full backup, making them much quicker to execute and reducing the backup window.
2. **Storage Savings:** They consume less storage space compared to full backups because they are smaller in size, storing only the changes rather than the entire database.
3. **Resource Utilization:** By minimizing the I/O and CPU resources needed for backups, differential backups can reduce the impact on the serverâ€™s performance, particularly during peak hours.
4. **Restore Time:** When restoring, using a full backup followed by the most recent differential backup can be faster than restoring multiple incremental backups, reducing the downtime.
5. **Backup Frequency:** For large databases, taking frequent full backups might be impractical. Differential backups allow for more frequent backups without the overhead of a full backup every time.

#### 1.3 Conditions for Selecting Clustered/Non-Clustered Indexes

**Clustered Index:**
1. **Primary Key:** Often used for the primary key of the table because it ensures that data is physically sorted in the order of the key.
2. **Range Queries:** Beneficial for columns frequently used in range queries (e.g., date ranges) because the data is physically stored in a contiguous block, making range retrieval faster.
3. **Unchanging Columns:** Ideal for columns that are not frequently updated, as changing the clustered key can cause data reorganization.

**Non-Clustered Index:**
1. **Secondary Keys:** Useful for columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, or as part of ORDER BY clauses but are not the primary key.
2. **Lookup Optimization:** Helps optimize searches for specific values without affecting the physical order of the rows.
3. **Multiple Indexing:** Allows multiple non-clustered indexes on a table, providing flexibility to optimize different types of queries.
4. **Filtered Indexes:** Non-clustered indexes can be filtered to include only a subset of rows, which can be very efficient for queries targeting specific subsets of data.
5. **Update Frequency:** Better suited for columns that are frequently updated, as non-clustered indexes do not require data reordering.

#### 1.4 Use of SQL Server Execution Plans in Real-World Situations

**Explanation:**
Execution plans are crucial for the following reasons:

1. **Query Optimization:** They provide insights into how SQL Server executes queries, allowing developers and DBAs to identify inefficient operations (e.g., table scans, missing indexes) and optimize them for better performance.
2. **Performance Tuning:** Execution plans help in pinpointing performance bottlenecks, such as expensive operations, by showing the cost associated with each part of the query.
3. **Index Recommendations:** They can suggest index improvements, helping to create or modify indexes that could make the query execution faster.
4. **Debugging:** Execution plans aid in debugging complex queries by breaking down the execution steps, making it easier to understand and fix issues.
5. **Baseline Comparison:** By comparing execution plans over time, one can track how query performance changes, identifying regressions or improvements after changes in the database schema, indexes, or query structure.

#### 1.5 Select Query to Display Names of All Constraints in Database NIBM

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    CONSTRAINT_NAME 
FROM 
    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS 
WHERE 
    CONSTRAINT_CATALOG = 'NIBM';
```



### Question 2 (Oracle)

#### 2.1 PL/SQL Block to Compute Tax Amount Based on Employee Salary

**PL/SQL Block:**

```plsql
DECLARE
    CURSOR emp_cursor IS
        SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, SALARY
        FROM EMPLOYEES;
    v_employee_id EMPLOYEES.EMPLOYEE_ID%TYPE;
    v_salary EMPLOYEES.SALARY%TYPE;
    v_tax_amount NUMBER;
BEGIN
    FOR emp_rec IN emp_cursor LOOP
        v_employee_id := emp_rec.EMPLOYEE_ID;
        v_salary := emp_rec.SALARY;

        IF v_salary IS NULL THEN
            v_tax_amount := 0;
        ELSIF v_salary BETWEEN 150000 AND 250000 THEN
            v_tax_amount := v_salary * 0.01;
        ELSIF v_salary BETWEEN 250001 AND 500000 THEN
            v_tax_amount := v_salary * 0.05;
        ELSIF v_salary > 500000 THEN
            v_tax_amount := v_salary * 0.10;
        ELSE
            v_tax_amount := 0;
        END IF;

        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee ID: ' || v_employee_id || ' Tax Amount: ' || v_tax_amount);
    END LOOP;
END;
```
### 2.2 PL/SQL Block to Print Specified Output Using a FOR Loop

```sql
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Program started.');
    
    FOR i IN 1..3 LOOP
        FOR j IN 1..i LOOP
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(i);
        END LOOP;
    END LOOP;

    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Program completed.');
END;
```

### Question 4 (MongoDB)

#### 4.1 Justification for Using MongoDB

The student proposed MongoDB as the suitable database management system for developing highly available and scalable internet applications. Here are five points justifying this choice:

1. **Horizontal Scale-Out Architecture:**
   - MongoDB supports sharding, a method for distributing data across multiple machines. This horizontal scaling allows for handling large volumes of data and high-throughput applications by adding more servers rather than upgrading existing ones.

2. **Flexible Schema:**
   - MongoDB uses a document-oriented data model, allowing for a flexible schema. This means that documents in a collection do not need to have the same set of fields, and data structures can evolve over time without requiring alterations to the existing data model.

3. **High Availability:**
   - MongoDB provides high availability through replica sets, which are groups of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and automated failover. This ensures that the application remains available even if some servers fail.

4. **Support for Unstructured Data:**
   - MongoDB can store and manage unstructured or semi-structured data efficiently. This is particularly useful for applications that deal with varied and unpredictable data formats, such as social media content or log data.

5. **Developer Productivity:**
   - The document-based structure of MongoDB, along with its support for rich queries, indexing, and aggregation, makes it easier for developers to work with data in a natural, object-oriented manner. This reduces the impedance mismatch between the database and the application code.
